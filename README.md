Final Project for IBM Skills Network Introduction to Web Development
The project requested that I host my files onto my github. All project files are included in this respository. 
This project and it's original, unedited files belong to the Coursera course "IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate" taught by the IBM Skills Network.
I've edited the files to create my simple calculator project in HTML5, css and Javascript.  I took and uploaded screenshots of the calculator operating as intended.
